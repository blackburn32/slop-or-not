## What is Slop?

"Slop" is internet slang for low-effort AI-generated images churned out by algorithms without much human creativity or oversight. 
Think: weirdly perfect faces, distorted hands, or uncanny backgrounds that just feel wrong.
But as AI tools get better, slop is getting harder to spot. 
Some images look almost too real—making it tricky to know what’s authentic and what’s artificial.

## Why it Matters

The internet is being flooded with AI-generated images. Some are harmless, but others are used to spread misinformation, fake events, or scam people.
Being able to spot the slop isn’t just a fun party trick, it’s becoming an essential media literacy skill!

## What We're Doing
Slop or Not is a quick, interactive game designed to sharpen your eye.
1. We test your instincts first – Can you tell what’s AI and what’s real?
2. Then we teach you the tricks – Learn the telltale signs of AI-generated images.
3. You play again – See if you can beat your first score and become a certified Slop Spotter.

## Our Goal
We want to help people become savvier, more skeptical consumers of digital content—and have some fun along the way. 
Because once you know what to look for, you’ll never scroll past AI slop the same way again.
